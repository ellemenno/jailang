# {{ page.title }}

**jai** is the file extension for source code files, and the name of the compiler, but what does it mean? How do you pronounce it?
{:.larger.text}

Jai is pronounced **/dʒɑɪ/** [^pronunciation], rhyming with ‘chai’, like the tea.

As far as meaning, there does not seem to be an official answer yet[^no-answer1] [^no-answer2], so we are left with guesses:

* जय - victory! in Hindi [^jai-mata-di] [^victory1] [^victory2]
* j.a.i. - jonathan's awesome idea [^idea]
